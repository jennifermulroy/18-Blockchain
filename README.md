# 18-Blockchain Proof of Authority Development Chain


For this assignment, I am taking the role of a new developer at Zbank, a small, innovative bank, that is interested in exploring what blockchain technology can do for them and their customers. My first project at the company is to set up a private testnet with a team of developers to explore potentials for blockchain at ZBank.

By setting up a testnet, there is no real money involved, which will give our team the freedom to experiment. Testnets allows for offline development. 

To set up a testnet, I will need to use the following skills/tools:

- Puppeth, to generate the genesis block

- Geth, a command-line tool, to create keys, initialize nodes, and connect the nodes together

- The Clique Proof of Authority algorithm

Tokens inherently have no value here, so pre-configured accounts and nodes for easy setup will be provided as well as documentation.

# 1. Blockchain Installation Guide

To get started building blockchain, software tools and utilities need to be installed and environments configured. 

1. **Important Note:** Windows users **MUST** use `git-bash` and not the default Windows command prompt. 

2. [MyCrypto](https://www.mycrypto.com/) is a free, open-source, client-side interface that allows direct interaction with blockchain. MyCrypto Desktop App will be used to manage ethereum wallets and make transactions in the blockchain. To install, navigate to the downloads page at https://download.mycrypto.com/.
